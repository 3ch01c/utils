# How to set up Pi TFT
Adafruit makes a handy script for this:
```
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/master/adafruit-pitft.sh
chmod +x adafruit-pitft.sh
sudo ./adafruit-pitft.sh
```
Choose your screen.

Choose your rotation. 270 rotates so the USB power input is up.

If you want to boot to CLI, say _Yes_ to the question about displaying the console. If you want to boot to GUI, say _Yes_ to the question about mirroring HDMI.
